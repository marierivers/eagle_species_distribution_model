# Bald Eagle Species Distribution Model

This repository illustrates use of the Maxent (Maximum Entropy) model to predict the spatial distribution of a species based on presence data and environmental data. This examples uses bald eagle observations from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](GBIF.org) and environmental data from [WorldClim]( https://www.worldclim.org).
